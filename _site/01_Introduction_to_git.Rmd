Half of this class is all about protecting future you from current you.

You're code is going to explode as you explore your data. Life is going to get messy. So we're going to start keeping track of the work that we're doing using something called version control. The specific tool we're going to use is git. It's awesome! And I desperately wish that someone had taught this to me years ago. As long as you are diligent about using it.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
