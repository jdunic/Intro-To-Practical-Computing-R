### News - September 22, 2015

If you missed the readings from last week, you can find them on the 
[**Readings**](pages/readings.html) page. Make sure you have read the style 
guides! I will be looking for consistent and easy to read code on your homework!

* Hadley Wickham's style guide - 
  [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
* Google's R style guide - 
  [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml)  

**Exercises:** An initial set of exercises that have you practice subsetting 
vectors can be found [**here**](pages/exercises_01_subsetting.html). More exercises 
will be posted in the exercise section below.  

**Homework:** A draft of [homework 2](pages/homework/homework_02.html) is now 
posted. It may seem a bit long so I may limit how much of it needs to be done. 
For now, this is a good chance to start practising your plot making. 

[ggplot2 notes](pages/05_introduction_to_ggplot.html) are still in progress. I 
have posted what is done up to now, but I will continue to clean them up through 
the week.

### Readings for Thursday, Sept 24

* Hadley Wickham's [*A layered grammar of graphics*](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf) is worth a skim.  

* For those who are itching for more readings, feel free to also look over 
[*The split-apply-combine strategy for data analysis*](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i01/paper). Although it refers to a package plyr that has been superceded by Hadley's 
dplyr package, the fundamental approach and description of data analysis remains 
the same.
