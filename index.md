### Readings for Tuesday September 29th

* Hadley Wickham's chapter on subsetting in Advanced-R [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html)

I encourage you to enter some of his demonstrations in R.   

**Here are some questions to help focus your reading:**  

1. What are the three subsetting operators?

2. What is a vector?

3. What types of vectors are there (you have already seen at least three of these)?

4. What are 5 different data types (ignore the S3/S4 stuff)?

5. If this was enough, you can stop at the Subsetting and Assignment heading.
