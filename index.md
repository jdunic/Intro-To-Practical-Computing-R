### News - September 11, 2015

**Reminder** - regular class times begin: Tuesday / Thursday 9:00 - 10:00  

**Homework:**  
[Homework 01](pages/homework_01.html) is now up! It will be due on Wednesday by midnight so that you have time to ask me questions on Tuesday.  

Check [here](pages/homework_submission.html) for instructions on how to submit your homework (No more emailing! Everything will be done via Github!)  

[Introduction to git walkthrough](pages/01_introduction_to_git.html) and [Git + Rstudio + Rmarkdown walkthrough](pages/02_introduction_to_Rstudio.html) pages have been updated. Go through them again if you want more practice. They will also help you with the homework. If you notice anything that needs further clarification (e.g., addition of more screenshots, errors that come up, etc., please post an [issue](https://github.com/jdunic/Intro-To-Practical-Computing-R/issues) so that I can fix them!)

### Readings for Thursday, Sept 17

Coding style matters, it makes your code more readable--a benefit to both future 
you and your colleagues. Read through both of these style guides. They are very 
similar, but you can choose to use the conventions of either. Just make sure you 
work on consistency.  

* Hadley Wickham's style guide - 
  [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
* Google's R style guide - 
  [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml)  

Skim over this. It is definitely worth the read. Skim it now, but come back to 
it throughout the semester because you will learn more and more each time you 
look at it. This page is just one section, there are three others: Atomic 
vectors, Factors, and Data frames. Feel free to skim over these sections for 
'gotchas' that you *will* come across. We will however, read these as we cover 
these topics in class.  

* aRrgh: a newcomerâ€™s (angry) guide to R - 
  [Basic syntax](http://arrgh.tim-smith.us/syntax.html)  

Last, read this git cheatsheet. The first page is a good reference for commands, 
while the second page covers best practices that we touched on in class. Again, 
remind yourself of these periodically!
