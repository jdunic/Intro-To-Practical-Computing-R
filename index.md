### News - September 22, 2015

#### * Read the dplyr tutorial for Tuesday!

**Exercises:** An initial set of exercises that have you practice subsetting 
vectors can be found [**here**](pages/exercises_01_subsetting.html). More exercises 
will be posted in the exercise section below.  


**Homework:** A draft of [homework 2](pages/homework/homework_02.html) is now 
posted. It may seem a bit long so I may limit how much of it needs to be done. 
For now, this is a good chance to start practising your plot making.   

**Notes**  
[ggplot2 notes](pages/05_introduction_to_ggplot.html) are still in progress. I 
have posted what is done up to now, but I will continue to clean them up through 
the week.

### Readings for Tuesday September 29th

* Read through and try out this online [dplyr tutorial](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) - it will clarify what we did in class.  

* For those who are itching for more readings, feel free to also look over 
[*The split-apply-combine strategy for data analysis*](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i01/paper). Although it refers to a package plyr that has been superceded by Hadley's 
dplyr package, the fundamental approach and description of data analysis remains 
the same.
