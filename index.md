### News - September 11, 2015

**Reminder** - regular class times begin: Tuesday / Thursday 9:00 - 10:00  

**Homework:**  
[Homework 01](pages/homework_01.html) is now up! It will be due on Wednesday by midnight so that you have time to ask me questions on Tuesday.  

Check [here](pages/homework_submission.html) for instructions on how to submit your homework (No more emailing! Everything will be done via Github!)  

[Introduction to git walkthrough](pages/01_introduction_to_git.html) and [Git + Rstudio + Rmarkdown walkthrough](pages/02_introduction_to_Rstudio.html) pages have been updated. Go through them again if you want more practice. They will also help you with the homework. If you notice anything that needs further clarification (e.g., addition of more screenshots, errors that come up, etc., please post an [issue](https://github.com/jdunic/Intro-To-Practical-Computing-R/issues) so that I can fix them!)


**Tuesday's plan**  
On Tuesday we will touch base on how everyone is feeling with Git, so bring questions (or post them on issues page first so that we can solve problems before class). Then we will get started with R!  

To prepare for this, check out the first and second lessons ('Basic Building Blocks' and 'Workspace and Files') in swirl. If some of it is blind following, that's okay! Bring any questions you have to class!
