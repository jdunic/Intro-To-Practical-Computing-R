### News - September 29, 2015

**There is a reading for Thursday!**  

**Exercises:** None currently.  

**Homework:** [Homework 2](pages/homework/homework_02.html) is due on Wednesday. 
Remember to follow a style guide - consistent, coherent, easy to read code--it 
makes life better for all of us (mostly you!).   

* Hadley Wickham's style guide - 
  [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
* Google's R style guide - 
  [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml) 

**Notes**  
This [dplyr tutorial](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) is quite good, I recommend checking it out if you have been 
struggling, or would like some review.

### Readings for Tuesday September 29th

* Hadley Wickham's chapter on subsetting in Advanced-R [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html)

I encourage you to enter some of his demonstrations in R.   

**Here are some questions to help focus your reading:**  

1. What are the three subsetting operators?

2. What is a vector?

3. What types of vectors are there (you have already seen at least three of these)?

4. What are 5 different data types (ignore the S3/S4 stuff)?

5. If this was enough, you can stop at the Subsetting and Assignment heading.
