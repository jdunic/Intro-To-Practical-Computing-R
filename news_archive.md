We will be using the command line to work with git for the rest of the week. If you would like to go through a simple walkthrough of the terminal commands I've posted one [here](pages/brief_cmdline_intro.html) on the Resources page.  

[Git intro walkthrough](pages/01_introduction_to_git.html) is now online if anyone wants to take a sneak peak, or go back over it after class.  

[Git + RStudio + Rmarkdown walkthrough](pages/02_introduction_to_Rstudio.html) is also now online. Feel free to review.
