#### 5) Free stuff!
On Github Request an education discount! They have created a student developer pack with free access to various tools that are worth checking out! I recommend requesting your educational discount now, as these take time to process.

#### Troubleshooting
If you have problems installing these programs prior to class. Please email me asap. We will have some time dedicated at the start of class to troubleshooting. For those of you who already have some experience with these programs, please assist your neighbours in class who may be having troubles.  



#### Success and more?
If you are successful in setting up your computer and would like to get your feet wet in R, you can also install the package 'Swirl' and try some of the interactive tutorials.

####Terminal Tinkering -- for Mac and Linux users only
Please attempt to play, even for 10 minutes with your terminal. This may be completely new to most of you.

#####Opening a terminal
Mac  
Type 'terminal' into spotlight  


Now that you have a terminal open try the following commands  

*Change directory*
```
cd ~  
```
This should put you in your home directory

*List the files in your directory*
```
ls -a
```

*Change directory*
```
cd type_directory_name_or_path_here
```

*Get the path to your current directory*
```
pwd
```
*Go back to the directory one level up*
```
cd ..
```

More commands can be found here if you are interested in learning more. But for now I just want you to have some exposure. Note - a directory is just a folder.
