title: Homework 1 - write a README.md
description: Use rmarkdown to add a README to your homework repository
---

1. Create a repository on Github that will be your homework repository. Name it **BIOL-653-lastname-firstname**. For those of you who have already created a repository for your homework, you can rename it via Github. On your repository page, go to settings and at the top you will can just change the name of the repository. 

2. Add/edit a README.md to your homework repository.

3. Include a brief description of the workflow that you used to edit it. Practice pulling changes in your repository on Github to your local computer, making the changes or adding a README.md through RStudio, then adding, commiting, and pushing those changes back. This is a good place for you to take notes for yourself. 

4. Include 3 markdown formats in your README.md (e.g., bold, italic, headers, inline code, bullet points, etc.,). The RStudio team has created some awesome cheatsheets, checkout this [R Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)!
