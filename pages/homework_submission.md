#### Setup your homework repository

Some of you have already started to setup a homework repository.  

* Create a repository on Github called BIOL-563-lastname-firstname-hw (or rename the repository on Github that you setup in class the other day that was meant for homework).
* If you have received your Github education discount you can make this repository private and 
* The name of the folder on your computer doesn't matter, so you can keep it called <homework> or whatever you may have already called it (keeping it short and simple can be nice)
* Add me, jdunic, as a contributor.

Now you're ready to go!  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Submit your homework
* Post an issue to your repository saying "Homework X - Lastname, Firstname has been submitted!"
* Tag me, @jdunic, in the description of your issue.
* Provide a link to the page that contains the homework file that you want me to look at.  

* This is all for now. As class continues, we may revise this. I will keep you posted.
