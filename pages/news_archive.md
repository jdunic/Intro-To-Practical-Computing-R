**News - September 24, 2015**

 * Read the dplyr tutorial for Tuesday!

**Exercises:** An initial set of exercises that have you practice subsetting 
vectors can be found [**here**](exercises_01_subsetting.html). More exercises 
will be posted in the exercise section below.  

[Dplyr questions from Thursday's class](dplyr_sept24_exercises.html)  


**Homework:** A draft of [homework 2](homework/homework_02.html) is now 
posted. It may seem a bit long so I may limit how much of it needs to be done. 
For now, this is a good chance to start practising your plot making.   

**Notes**  
[ggplot2 notes](05_introduction_to_ggplot.html) are still in progress. I 
have posted what is done up to now, but I will continue to clean them up through 
the week. 


**News - September 22, 2015**

If you missed the readings from last week, you can find them on the 
[**Readings**](readings.html) page. Make sure you have read the style 
guides! I will be looking for consistent and easy to read code on your homework!

**News - September 11, 2015**
On Tuesday we will touch base on how everyone is feeling with Git, so bring questions (or post them on issues page first so that we can solve problems before class). Then we will get started with R!  

To prepare for this, check out the first and second lessons ('Basic Building Blocks' and 'Workspace and Files') in swirl. If some of it is blind following, that's okay! Bring any questions you have to class!

*Reminder* - regular class times begin: Tuesday / Thursday 9:00 - 10:00  

Updates from Friday's class coming by Sunday night. The walkthroughs that are online now need to have some corrections and clarifications made.  

I will be:

* posting the first homework (aiming by tonight/tomorrow)
* updating the [git intro walkthrough](01_introduction_to_git.html)
* updating the [git + Rstudio + Rmarkdown walkthrough](02_introduction_to_Rstudio.html)
* posting what you need to do to prepare for Tuesday's class

**September 9th, 2015**
We will be using the command line to work with git for the rest of the week. If you would like to go through a simple walkthrough of the terminal commands I've posted one [here](brief_cmdline_intro.html) on the Resources page.  

[Git intro walkthrough](01_introduction_to_git.html) is now online if anyone wants to take a sneak peak, or go back over it after class.  

[Git + RStudio + Rmarkdown walkthrough](02_introduction_to_Rstudio.html) is also now online. Feel free to review.
