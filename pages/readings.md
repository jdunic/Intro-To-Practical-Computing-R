### Readings for Tuesday September 29th

* Hadley Wickham's chapter on subsetting in Advanced-R [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html)

I encourage you to enter some of his demonstrations in R.   

**Here are some questions to help focus your reading:**  

1. What are the three subsetting operators?

2. What is a vector?

3. What types of vectors are there (you have already seen at least three of these)?

4. What are 5 different data types (ignore the S3/S4 stuff)?

5. If this was enough, you can stop at the Subsetting and Assignment heading. 


### Readings for Tuesday September 29th

* Read through and try out this online [dplyr tutorial](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) - it will clarify what we did in class.  

* For those who are itching for more readings, feel free to also look over 
[*The split-apply-combine strategy for data analysis*](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i01/paper). Although it refers to a package plyr that has been superceded by Hadley's 
dplyr package, the fundamental approach and description of data analysis remains 
the same.


### Readings for Thursday, Sept 17

Coding style matters, it makes your code more readable--a benefit to both future 
you and your colleagues. Read through both of these style guides. They are very 
similar, but you can choose to use the conventions of either. Just make sure you 
work on consistency.  

* Hadley Wickham's style guide - 
  [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
* Google's R style guide - 
  [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml)  

Skim over this. It is definitely worth the read. Skim it now, but come back to 
it throughout the semester because you will learn more and more each time you 
look at it. This page is just one section, there are three others: Atomic 
vectors, Factors, and Data frames. Feel free to skim over these sections for 
'gotchas' that you *will* come across. We will however, read these as we cover 
these topics in class.  

* aRrgh: a newcomerâ€™s (angry) guide to R - 
  [Basic syntax](http://arrgh.tim-smith.us/syntax.html)  

Last, read this git cheatsheet. The first page is a good reference for commands, 
while the second page covers best practices that we touched on in class. Again, 
remind yourself of these periodically!
