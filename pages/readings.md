### Readings for Thursday, Sept 17

Coding style matters, it makes your code more readable--a benefit to both future 
you and your colleagues. Read through both of these style guides. They are very 
similar, but you can choose to use the conventions of either. Just make sure you 
work on consistency.  

* Hadley Wickham's style guide - 
  [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
* Google's R style guide - 
  [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml)  

Skim over this. It is definitely worth the read. Skim it now, but come back to 
it throughout the semester because you will learn more and more each time you 
look at it. This page is just one section, there are three others: Atomic 
vectors, Factors, and Data frames. Feel free to skim over these sections for 
'gotchas' that you *will* come across. We will however, read these as we cover 
these topics in class.  

* aRrgh: a newcomerâ€™s (angry) guide to R - 
  [Basic syntax](http://arrgh.tim-smith.us/syntax.html)  

Last, read this git cheatsheet. The first page is a good reference for commands, 
while the second page covers best practices that we touched on in class. Again, 
remind yourself of these periodically!
